/**
 * Uncapitalizes He/Him/His/Himself where the referent is clearly human (or
 * animal), to fix over-capitalization from the original script.
 *
 * Two passes:
 * 1. In verses with NO divine referent: lowercase all four pronouns (fixes
 *    mistaken caps from the "continuation" rule).
 * 2. In all text: apply a list of phrase replacements where the pronoun
 *    unambiguously refers to a human (e.g. "the man and His wife" -> "his").
 *
 * Run after capitalize-divine-pronouns-conservative.js (or after the original
 * capitalize script) to clean up remaining false positives.
 *
 * Usage: node uncapitalize-human-pronouns.js [--dry-run]
